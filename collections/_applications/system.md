FDS has developed a design system to ensure its modernized applications have a common look and feel, meet government’s branding requirements, and are accessible to all users.

A design system is a collection of guidelines, standards, and reusable components. It serves to ensure a website or application (or a collection of related websites or applications, like FDS) is cohesive and easy to use.

The design system is being used on all the modernized applications.

FDS’s system meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) double A standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). This is the international standard for accessible websites and application interfaces.
