The FSA has developed a design system to ensure its modernized applications have a common look and feel, meet government’s branding requirements, and are accessible to all users.

A design system is a collection of guidelines, standards, and reusable components. It helps designers and developers because it defines the appearance, structure, and behaviour of a user interface. Ultimately, a design system serves to ensure a website or application (or a collection of related websites or applications, like the FSA) is cohesive and easy to use.

The FSA design system includes design principles, brand guidelines, typography, UI components, design patterns, interaction guidelines, and accessibility.

The system promotes consistency, efficiency, and scalability of design, and helps designers and developers collaborate while working to a common design standard. The design system will be used in all the modernized applications.

Carbon Design System
The FSA design system is built on IBM’s Carbon Design System. Carbon was chosen because it’s both open source and a complete system, which means it’s free, well maintained by both IBM and the community, and easily customizable and extensible.

Carbon is also built for collaboration. Designers can use it to prototype designs while developers can easily build and implement those designs using the corresponding code. This seamless collaboration streamlines the design-to-development workflow and helps bridge the gap between design and implementation.

The FSA is committed to meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) double A standard, which is the accepted international standard for accessible websites and application interfaces. The double A standard specifies objectives for designers to meet to ensure people with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments can access websites and applications.

The modernization program selected Carbon because of its evident commitment to accessibility. Most of its components are already compliant with WCAG standards, and it includes tools to help designers and developers create applications that are accessible to everyone.

People with disabilities need accessible design but others benefit from it, too, including the elderly, people with temporary impairments, and anyone with poor internet connectivity. Websites and applications that follow inclusive design principles find larger audiences and provide a better user experience for all.
