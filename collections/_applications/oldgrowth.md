## Overview
The Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel identified old growth areas that are at imminent risk of biodiversity loss and harvesting should be deferred. The current deferral process could require that licensees do field verification to confirm, add or delete areas meeting the definition of old growth trees. However, government does not have a corporate solution that will enable the tracking and management of the potential deferral areas and any decisions that come out of that process that may impact licensees
