Team Alliance is modernizing CLIENT, which is the Ministry of Forests’ system for managing its business relationship with B.C.'s forest sector and other natural resource industries. 

Taking a human centred design approach, Alliance has so far:  

- Interviewed CLIENT users to understand their experience 
- Mapped the application’s current state, identified pain points, and pinpointed improvements 
- Developed prototypes and business logic for the new application 
- Strategized how to move CLIENT's legacy data to a modern database, and 
- Developed APIs to populate CLIENT with data automatically
