Team Alliance is in the process of modernizing the Forests Client Management System (Client), which is the Ministry of Forests’ system for managing its business relationship with B.C.’s forest sector and other natural resource industries.

So far, Alliance has:

- Launched an [online form](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=E290320237694A9584C0CABC5DE3B9F2) so legal entities and individuals can request a Ministry of Forests client number via the web, and
- Implemented a dashboard to make it easy for ministry staff to manage online client number submissions.

The team continues to develop, test, and refine other improvements to Client. These include improvements to the new dashboard to allow staff to create client numbers and better search functionality. The team's goal is to launch these features later in 2024.
