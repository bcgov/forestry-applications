Team Alliance is modernizing the Client Management System, which is the Ministry of Forests’ system for managing its business relationship with B.C.’s forest sector and other natural resource industries.

Taking a human centred design approach, Alliance has so far:

- Mapped the application’s current state, identified pain points, and pinpointed improvements
- Created prototypes and business logic for the new application
- Written APIs to populate Client with data automatically, and 
- Built and is testing Client's intake form and dashboard in a development environment

The team continues to develop, test, and refine Client with a goal of launching a “simplified” version of the application by the end of 2023.
