## Overview
The Natural Resource Sector (NRS) has relied extensively on WebADE for digital authorization for decades. The existing applications that are candidates for modernization under the Forest Service Applications Modernization Project (FSA) are almost all tightly coupled with the WebADE system. There is a complex operational data set, managed by a front-end application called ADAM, that is used to define authorization permissions, groups, and assignments. The modern applications being created under the FSA project will not be compatible with WebADE and will not be able to use ADAM for authorization management.

The Forests Authorization Management product (FAM) will meet the needs of the sector to allow business users to define and assign groups and roles. FAM will integrate with an OIDC service so that authorization context will be securely and transparently included in the context of any authentication process.
