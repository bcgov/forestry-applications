Team Encora is modernizing the Seed Planning and Registry (SPAR) and the Cone and Seed Program (CONSEP). 

SPAR is the Ministry of Forests’ online tree seed registry. It's used to: 
- Track information about seedlots, orchards, and parent trees 
- Order seeds, seedlings, and cones, and 
- Request seed processing, sampling, testing, and transfers 

CONSEP tracks seeds in the [Tree Seed Centre](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B33FA5CCACF949158DA2DA602A6D9C5F)'s freezers, contains seed preparation recipes, and integrates with the centre’s hardware. 

The team has done extensive service design with SPAR and CONSEP users, including: 
- Mapping the applications’ current states 
- Identifying pain points, and 
- Recognizing functions to improve 

The team has also developed a design system which the FSA program will use on all the applications it modernizes. Watch this [SPAR demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fSDjj-bAbE) to see how the design system will improve the user experience.
